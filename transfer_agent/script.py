"""Now, let's start the fun part of the test. Jim has an account on the first bank and Emma has an account
on the second bank. Jim owns Emma 20000â‚¬. Emma is already a bit angry, because she did not get the
money although Jim told her that he already sent it.

Help Jim send his money by developing a transfer agent. You have to build up a transfer agent client
application that will consume your API, and perform transfers between those two banks.
This agent assures that everybody gets their money. When the agent receives an order to transfer money
from account A to account B, he issues transfers considering commissions, transfer limits and
possibility of transfer failures.
